This project demonstrates a 3-stage Jenkins pipeline using Freestyle Jobs:

✅ Build Job: Generates advice.json with a motivational programming message.

🧪 Test Job: Validates the JSON and extracts the message into advice.message.

🚀 Deploy Job: Displays the final message using a random cowsay character in the terminal.

🖥️ Built on Ubuntu 24.04 (VirtualBox) and powered by tools like jq and cowsay.
